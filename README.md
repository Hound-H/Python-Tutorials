# PythonTutorial
Welcome to Down The Snake Hole, a curated collection of Python scripts documenting my journey through the language's fundamentals. This repository serves as a learning log, encompassing a range of core concepts such as user input handling, mathematical functions, string slicing, conditional statements, various loop constructs—including while, for, and nested loops—as well as loop control mechanisms like break and continue. Each script is designed to focus on a specific topic, providing clear and concise examples to reinforce understanding.​

This project is a work in progress, with plans to expand into more advanced areas like object-oriented programming, file I/O, and exception handling. Whether you're a fellow learner or an experienced developer revisiting the basics, I hope this repository offers valuable insights and practical examples to support your Python programming journey.
